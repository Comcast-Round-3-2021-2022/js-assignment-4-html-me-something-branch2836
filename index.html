           <h2>Getting to the Island</h2>
           <p>Ocracoke is an island, you can access it by air or the way we did, a ferry. We boarded early in the morning from the Hatteras termainl. The ride was nice and calm with a nice breeze.</p>

           <h2>Accomodations</h2>
           <p>The house we sayed in was off a canal. It has two levels of screened in porches to allow you to enjoy the salt air without being bothered by insects. The layout is also upside down: the liviing areas are on the top floor to take advantage of the views and breezes. The bedrooms are on the middle floor and the bottom floor is almost empty for ease of cleanup when flooding occurs.</p>

           <h2>The Beach</h2>
           <p>The island is part of the Hatteras National Seashore under the Nationall Park Service. For being a holiday week, there was a surprising amount of room to spread out. You did need to make sure you stayed away from the roped off areas where sea turtle nests were located. </p>

            <h2>The Town</h2>
            <p class="funParagraph" id="testP">With just shy of 800 permanant residents, the town is small and tight&#8209;knit. There is very little parking so most people use golf carts to get around. Since we were there on the 4Th of July, we got to see the parade. </p>
